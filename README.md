# News-App

Developing a news app in React.js using an API involves fetching and displaying real-time news from a source like NewsAPI or The New York Times API.
A simple news application built with React.js that fetches and displays news from an external API.

Key Concepts:

1. Fetching Data from API
Use fetch() or axios to retrieve data from a news API.
Handle API keys securely using environment variables (.env file).

2. State Management
Use useState to store news articles.
Use useEffect to trigger API calls when the component mounts.

3. React Components
NewsList.jsx: Displays a list of articles.
NewsItem.jsx: Represents a single news article.
SearchBar.jsx: Allows users to search for specific news topics.

4. Routing 
Use react-router-dom to navigate between categories (e.g., Technology, Sports, Business).

5. Styling
Use CSS or frameworks like Material-UI.

Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm start
